Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment using demographic, lifestyle, and medical data to accurately predict the likelihood of CVD occurrence in individuals by employing advanced machine learning techniques and create a reliable tool for early detection of CVD risk factors. 
The ultimate goal is to facilitate proactive interventions and personalized preventive strategies to mitigate the burden of CVD and improve public health outcomes using Machine Learning Algorithms.

Introduction

Heart failure, peripheral artery disease, coronary artery disease, and stroke are among the disorders that fall under the umbrella term of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which affects the heart and blood arteries. Being one of the world's top causes of death, CVD presents a serious public health issue. Modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) include physical inactivity, bad food, smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, and physical inactivity; non-modifiable risk factors include age, gender, and family history. Depending on the exact ailment, symptoms of cardiovascular disease (CVD) can include leg edoema, exhaustion, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. In addition to medical therapies like medication and surgery, lifestyle modifications like quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy diet, and getting regular exercise are all important in the prevention and management of CVD.

The main strategies used to fight CVD are risk factor reduction, early detection, and public health campaigns that encourage heart-healthy lifestyle choices. It is feasible to lower the incidence of CVD and the morbidity and mortality that are linked to it by educating people about the risk factors for the disease and motivating them to lead healthier lifestyles. Furthermore, improvements in CVD diagnosis, treatment, and management are a result of advances in medical science and technology. By implementing a holistic strategy that includes prevention, early identification, and efficient management, notable progress can be achieved in reducing the worldwide prevalence of cardiovascular disease.
